lookatx started as a messaging group between two nerds sharing interesting and cool resources that they ran across on the internet. the messaging group was small and invite only for almost 3 years, not because it was exclusive but because it was just meant for friends. we'd accumulated a surprisingly large corpus of links but it had limited access. lookatx.dev facilitates easier access to sharing resources we or anyone else in the community comes across surfing the wild waves of the internet.
